# Kaggle Connectivity Issue Log - September 13, 2025

## Summary of Problem

As of September 13, I am completely unable to use Kaggle.com, or a subdomain from my location. All other non-Kaggle websites are working correctly. This appears to be a localized network routing or DNS issue specific to Kaggle's services.

## Troubleshooting Performed

- The issue is persistent and has been occurring for several hours, immediately after I opened [my account](https://www.kaggle.com/eeshvardas)
- The problem occurs across two different cellular carriers.
- All standard device-side troubleshooting has been performed, including a full device restart and network troubleshooting with no effect.
- The primary browser error is `DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN`.

## Status

This repository will be updated if the status changes. The issue prevents any use of the Kaggle platform, including accessing datasets or using the "Copy & Edit" feature on notebooks, and submitting a bug report directly to Kaggle.
